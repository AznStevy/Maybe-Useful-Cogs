# Maybe-Useful-Cogs
A few cogs for [Twentysix's Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).
To add, do `[p]cog repo add stevy https://github.com/AznStevy/Maybe-Useful-Cogs/`

**About Cogs**

>Osu - I play the game and have a discord server, so I thought it would be nice to have an osu cog.

>Leveler - A level-up system using python. (Designed by LadyGhost).

>Discomegle - More people/servers, more fun. You are put into a pool that the bot keeps track of and you can talk anonymously to a partner.

>Markov - Markov. It is what it is.

>Whoplays - Look at what games people in the server are playing.

**Why...** 

>Because I wanted to make them.

**Do you suck?** 

>Oh.

**_Support_** 

If you would like some support for these cogs because nothing ever works, you can talk to me in my testing/spam server, [bot testing](https://discord.gg/T5HHf7k). I don't bite, I promise :3

__Leveler Support__ - Firstly, visit this awesome site dimxxz made: http://dimxxz.net/lvlsupport.html. If those things don't work, read on. `pip3 install scipy` is known to not work on Windows (Linux should work fine **along with** `pip3 install numpy`). Scipy is NOT required, but needed for auto color generation. I personally would recommend downloading it because having the auto command is the difference between http://puu.sh/qLpja/dd46470fda.jpg and http://puu.sh/qL7hK/d94cad0936.jpg. I think you can tell the difference.

1) Go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy, download your version (python version + 32/64-bit), `pip3 install (exact location of downloaded file)`. Then, do the same for http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy.

2) Google! It's your friend!

3) Come to the [support server](https://discord.gg/T5HHf7k) to complain or just to hang out c:

MongoDB - Leveler now requires the use of MongoDB. If you are on ubuntu, try [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04). If you are on Windows, try [this](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#install-mongodb-community-edition) (Keep this console separate and open). If you are on another Linux distro, try [this](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/). You will also need to install the python module by doing `pip3 install pymongo`.

__Support Me__ - If you would like to give donations to a broke uni student, you can visit my [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/stevy) or donate using __Ethereum at: 0xc7174681a91e00285de5fb5f0eb39c9554eb72b3__. Thanks a bunch!
